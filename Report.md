# Introduction / Business Problem


In any big city you can see a lot of advertisement on the streets, like billboards, people
giving flyers for advertising an event or product, etc. This advertisement is not designed to be
changed during the day. What if we can implement a system where we keep track on the
trending venues around a specific location during the day and change advertisement on digital
billboards accordingly.

Here is a scenario:
Advertisement agency owns many advertising platforms (like digital billboards, digital ads in
public transport, people with flyers, etc) in downtown of a big city (Toronto in our case). This
agency has many clients with different products and services that are being advertised on
these platforms.


During the day we collect information on the trending venues around specific locations
(where digital ads platforms located) and then change ads depending on these trends. For
example if we see that during winter morning coffee shops are trending, we can set ads
platform to advertise our clients coffee shop, then good restaurant at lunch time and finally
theatre premier in the evening. All this depends on trending venues for this time of a day and
our observations.
