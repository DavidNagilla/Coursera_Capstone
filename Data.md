# Data

In this project I’ll leverage the Foursquare location data to solve our problem.
Foursquare allows us to see trending venues. Depending on the time when we run calls to
Foursquare API, we might get different venues since the venues with the highest foot traffic are
fetched live.

As an example I’m going to use two popular tourist attractions in NewYork and Toronto.
Since both cities are at the same time zone, we will also be able to see if trends are different in
these two cities at the same time of a day. To make it interesting, I’ll pick similar places, tall
buildings that people going at to watch nice view - Empire State Building in NewYork and CN
Tower in Toronto. 

In future, using the same technic, we can collect data from different parts of the day to
improve ads for our agency.
